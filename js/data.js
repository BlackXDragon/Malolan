	profile: "\tI am an aspiring robotics engineer. I am quite eccentric and find myself thinking about imaginary and complex situations out of the blue. While that might make me seem like an easily distractable person, I do maintain 100% concentration when working on anything important. I find small talk unnecessary and quite annoying. I'd rather discuss the concepts such as the future or reality and maybe gain some knowledge rather than get to know what's up.\n\n\tI find conflict between people unnecessary as what we all want in the end is rather just happiness. I love peace. I find current human technology to be in a war against nature. I aim to transform all the technology in the world into a more sustainable form and help the future generations live a life that has a harmonious mixture of technology and nature.\n\n\tI love reading books, and watching various movies, TV series and anime. While many people think these are distractions and a complete waste of time, I feel that audio-visual and textual media provide a source of peace to the mind as well as motivation. It is possible that a book or a movie might be what triggers your passion. Personally, I find the technology of Iron Man compelling. And I feel that if at all it is possible to create the Arc Reactor, it would be a huge game changer in the way electricity is currently generated.\n\n\tSpeaking of Iron Man, JARVIS is definitely one thing I'd love to see for real. Don't worry, I do share your concerns about the terminator and skynet, but I feel that the path that AI takes is completely in the hands of humans.",
